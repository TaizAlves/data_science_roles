<sub>My Path- changing carreer</sub>

I have a background in business finance and in 2018 I began studying programming as a way to automate daily tasks and streamline reporting processes. Since then, I've focused my studies on computer science and have completed several courses, including the CS50 Harvard introductory course for Computer Science, and the Microsoft SQL course on edx.

Additionally, in 2022, I completed a postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence from IBMEC in partnership with Microsoft, and I also finished Tera's Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp and I am always seeking to improve myself through other courses.

Throughout my career, I have gained experience in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and SQL, as well as in data analysis and visualization tools like PowerBI. In addition, I have developed strong skills in Numpy, Pandas and statistics.

In this resposity I have developed solutions for some market and sales problems such as customers segmentation and churn , Test A/B, a simple recomendation system for Market Basket Analysis using Apriori and some market KPI's.<smaller>Some solutions are parte of differents courses from DataCamp but always with some personnel addition.\*\*some are still in progress<smaller/>

Please check my others repositories for solutions using [classification](https://github.com/TaizAlves/cross_sell) and [regression](https://github.com/TaizAlves/ml-real-state-predictive-modeling) models as many others business solution´s projects.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

**Analytical Tools:**

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, MongoDB.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** Python, Spark, Airflow.

**Development:** Git, Linux and Docker.

**Data Vizualization:** Power BI.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series.

## Data Science Projects:

### [customers segmentation](https://github.com/TaizAlves/data_science_roles/blob/master/Machine_Learning/RFM.ipynb)

Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristic.Segmentation helps marketers to be more efficient in terms of time, money and other resources.Customer segmentation analysis can help make your business strategy more effective.

**Real life case scenario**: In my experience I´ve used this technique to gain a better understanding of customer's needs and wants and therefore could fit the best costumer cluster for a campaigns that had already been developed for a certain product.

In another case, a company I worked with was looking to reduce costs while maintaining growth, so the costumer´s undertanding was part of their strategy.

### [A/B Test](https://github.com/TaizAlves/data_science_roles/blob/master/A_B_test/statistics_A_B_test.ipynb)


### [Recomendation System](https://github.com/TaizAlves/data_science_roles/blob/master/KPIs_and_Exploratory/recommendation_system.ipynb)
Simple using apriori to understand the metrics and grafics used on thoses cases.


### [KPI´s](https://github.com/TaizAlves/data_science_roles/blob/master/KPIs_and_Exploratory/marketing_sales_KPI%C2%B4s.ipynb)

Key performance indicators to track. By tracking KPIs, you can measure the progress of your business towards its goals. You can see whether you are moving in the right direction or whether there are areas that require improvement.

On the notebook above I´ve used some market KPI´s.

**Real life case scenario**:By setting KPIs and tracking progress against them,  it´s possible to make decisions based on facts rather than guesswork.For me, it´s been a routine in most of the jobs I´ve worked to understand, measure, track and provide analysis based on the company's KPI´s.
